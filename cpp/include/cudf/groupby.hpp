  /**
   * @brief Performs grouped window-based aggregations on the specified values.
   * 
   * A `window_aggregation_request` specifies a column-vector of values to
   * aggregate, a list of aggregation operations, and the `window_bounds`
   * that governs each aggregation.
   * 
   * This method enables windowing queries such as the following: 
   * 
   * SELECT user_id,
   *        SUM(sales_amt) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY day ASC 
   *                          ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING and 1 FOLLOWING)
   * FROM my_table WHERE ...
   * 
   * Note: The groupby object must already be grouped and sorted appropriately,
   * before window-based `aggregate()` is invoked.
   * In the example above, the data would be grouped by `user_id`, and ordered
   * by `date`. The aggregation (SUM) would then be calculated for a window of
   * 3 values around (and including) each row.
   * 
   * If the input rows were as follows:
   * 
   *  [ 
   *    { "user1", 10, "Monday" },
   *    { "user2", 20, "Monday" },
   *    { "user1", 20, "Monday" },
   *    { "user1", 10, "Tuesday" },
   *    { "user2", 30, "Tuesday" },
   *    { "user2", 80, "Tuesday" },
   *    { "user1", 50, "Wednesday" },
   *    { "user1", 60, "Wednesday" },
   *    { "user2", 40, "Wednesday" }
   *  ]
   * 
   * Partitioning (grouping) by `user_id`, and ordering by `day` would yield
   * the following `sales_amt` vector (with 2 groups, * one for each distinct 
   * `user_id`):
   * 
   *    [ 10,  20,  10,  50,  60,  20,  30,  80,  40 ]
   *      <-------user1-------->|<------user2------->
   * 
   * The SUM aggregation would then be applied, with 1 preceding, and 1 following
   * row, with a minimum of 1 period. The aggregation window is thus 3 rows wide,
   * thereby yielding the following column:
   * 
   *    [ 30, 40,  80, 120, 100,  50, 130, 150, 120 ]
   * 
   * Note: The SUMs calculated at the group boundaries (i.e. indices 0,4,5, and 8)
   * consider only 2 values each, in spite of the window-size being 3.
   * Each aggregation operation cannot cross group boundaries.
   *
   * @param requests The list of window_aggregation_requests, specifying the columns
   * to aggregate, the aggregation operations per column, and the window-specification
   * per aggregation
   * @param mr Memory resource used to allocate the returned table and columns
   * @return Pair containing the table with each group's unique key and
   * a vector of aggregation_results for each request in the same order as
   * specified in `requests`.
